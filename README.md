# ASCII Art
Create ascii images from the commandline

## ToDo
- [x] Output ascii characters to text file _(togglable)_
- [x] Create new image which shows the source image pixels in ascii characters
- [x] Make the ascii characters represent the actual pixel color _(togglable)_
- [x] Change ascii character set _(haven't really decided on a default set)_
- [ ] Variable background color _(defaults to black, which makes the most sense)_
- [ ] Variable character dimensions on the final image _(default: 8,8)_
