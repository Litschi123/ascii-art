# ASCII Art
Create ascii images from the commandline

## ToDo
[x] Output ascii characters to text file (togglable)
[x] Create new image which shows the source image pixels in ascii characters
[x] Make the ascii characters represent the actual pixel color (togglable)
[x] Change ascii character set
[] Variable background color (currently black, which makes the most sense)
[] Variable character dimensions on the final image
